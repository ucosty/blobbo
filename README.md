# Blobbo

What you see here are the results of my efforts at reverse-enginnering the classic Mac game Blobbo. I was originally trying to get an equivelant to the full version of the game, since it seems to have dissapeared entirely from the internet.

### Getting Started

There are a number of sub-projects in this repository

1. level_decode allows you to decode/unpack original Blobbo levels
2. level_view allows you to view the blobbo levels

### Building

All of these were built on Linux, so they may not work out of the box on macOS or Windows. Contributions welcome to fix this up, if it helps. It should just be a matter of entering into the appropriate subdirectory and running make. The level viewer code requires SFML for drawing purposes.
